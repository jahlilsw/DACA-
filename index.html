	<h1> DACA INFO</h1>
	<p> I read this article from Youth Radio called <a href="https://youthradio.org/journalism/i-just-got-daca-and-now-trump-might-cancel-it/"> "I just got Daca and now Trump is cancelling it By Juan Mireles"</a> By . I learned how much people are affected by this change of law. This executive order doesn't benefit anyone, in fact it is costing the United States billions of dollars enforcing the new immigration laws. What is very surprising about all this is that DACA recipients weren't taking advantage of any government assistance because undocumented immigrants aren't even able to apply for these programs. In the article Juan explains the perspective of undocumented immigrants from his first hand experience. "First  We came out of the shadows, we are students, we are workers, we have families to take care of and we want to contribute to society. We aren’t taking away your money, we are in fact doing the opposite. We aren’t receiving food stamps, Medicaid benefits, or cash assistance because we are prohibited from many federal programs."  </p>

	<p>  51% say that a $465 fee to renew DACA will impose a financial hardship on themselves or their families. </p>
